# Development process

The running narrative: what happened, and why, newest at the bottom. Vlad's instructions are
quoted verbatim, in the same turn they arrive, because a paraphrase is already an interpretation.
A **HANDOFF** entry says where we are and the exact next step. It is kept current at every
milestone, so a context compaction or a switch of Claude account loses nothing.

## 2026-09-27: the repository is initialised

**Vlad, verbatim** (the one edit: a local folder path replaced, marked […]):

> "[…] – I wanna use these skills of multiple claude accounts sharing same sessions in that project"
>
> "I wanna implement research engine from that paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.19644
>
> So your task is to initialize project for that (to use claude terminal sessions) and create todo
> list with further tasks:
>
> * Analyze paper thoroughly and understand how does it work so we can write code to replicate it.
>   Analysis should be rigorous so we implement really solid and strong system. Maybe create
>   dedicated personas in advance: system architect, research engineer and so on. We should use
>   best coding practices for that project: use abstractions, identify components of that engine
>   (so its not just monolith) and so on
>
> At first just initialize repo – I will ask agent to start this job from dedicated chat"

With it he pasted a replication note from another assistant chat. It is saved as
[docs/inputs/2026-09-27-initial-replication-note.md](docs/inputs/2026-09-27-initial-replication-note.md),
and it is unverified.

Earlier the same day, in another project's chat, about the tooling behind the first sentence:
*"I think it is very important tool which allows me to switch between different claude accounts
without lose of any context using same worktrees and claude sessions."*

**What it changed:**
- `CLAUDE.md` holds working rules only, since the architecture comes from the analysis. Its
  principles:
  - quality first;
  - the paper is the specification;
  - requirements before code;
  - components, not a monolith;
  - research integrity enforced by the setup;
  - one task per worktree per session.
- **Six personas were created in advance,** in `.claude/agents/`:
  - `paper-analyst`;
  - `system-architect`;
  - `research-engineer`;
  - `evaluation-integrity-engineer`;
  - `agent-engineer`;
  - `infrastructure-engineer`.

  Each judges by a different measure, and the routing table is in the folder's README.
- **`TODO.md` sets the order:** analysis, then requirements, then components, then reuse, scope,
  integrity and testing, and only then a build plan.
- **Two process guides** in `docs/process/`: working in parallel worktrees, and switching Claude
  accounts without losing a session.

**Found while initialising:**
- The paper is *ScientistTwo: Pioneering the Human Knowledge Frontier with Autonomous AI*, v1 of
  17 September 2026, per the arXiv abstract page. Its table of contents, read from the HTML version:
  - six stages in §3.1–3.6;
  - Tables 1–11;
  - Appendices A–D, where A.2 is the configuration.
- The HTML shows the stage pseudocode as a figure (Figure 4), where the pasted note says
  "Listing 1". It is a first sign that the note must be checked claim by claim (TODO task 1).
- The GitHub repository is public, so no secret, credential, email address or local path may be
  committed (`CLAUDE.md`).

## 2026-09-27: TODO task 1 starts, the rigorous analysis of the paper

**Vlad, verbatim:**

> "Read CLAUDE.md, TODO.md and DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md, then start TODO task 1."

The session runs in the main checkout, on the branch `claude/paper-analysis` (nothing reaches
`main` without review).

**The sources, pinned.** arXiv:2609.19644 has one version, v1 of 17 September 2026, under
CC BY 4.0 (the abstract page's licence link). Its TeX source, PDF and HTML are fetched by
`playground/paper/fetch_sources.sh` into the gitignored `.cache/`, with each sha256 recorded and
checked. The licence allows redistribution with attribution, so the paper's TeX text is committed
under `docs/paper/source/`. The one change is `main.tex` line 46, redacted in place because it
lists two e-mail addresses; the line count is kept, so line anchors still match the archive.

**Found before any agent ran** (each re-runnable from `playground/paper/`):
- **"Listing 1" or "Figure 4": the note was right.** The TeX puts the stage pseudocode in a minted
  `listing` float, and the arXiv PDF prints "Listing 1". The HTML (LaTeXML) turns it into
  "Figure 4", so HTML Figures 5–12 are PDF Figures 4–11. Tables and sections agree. The analysis
  cites the PDF's numbers (`float_numbering.py`).
- **Discussion is §4.3,** a subsection of the experiments, and the conclusion is §5.
- **The page references of Appendices C and D are wrong by five** in the arXiv PDF: the artifacts
  said to be on pp. 29–50 are on pp. 34–55, and the case-study draft is on pp. 56–71.

**How the work is organised.** `docs/paper/README.md` is the one brief every analyst and reviewer
follows: sources and their authority, numbering, citation format, classification, IDs, and which
file each writer owns. `playground/paper/check_citations.py` enforces the citation rule: every
statement cites the paper or is marked `[ours]`, every TeX anchor exists, and every quote of five
words or more is found in the source. Its `--selftest` shows each check failing on a planted
defect. Four `paper-analyst` agents then write in parallel, each reading the whole paper
independently: `analysis.md`, `claims.md`, `note-check.md` and `artifacts.md`. A consolidation
pass builds `unspecified.md` and `traceability.md`. Four personas review in parallel, the owner
fixes, and a blind reader tests the result.

## HANDOFF, 2026-09-27 (task 1 in progress)

- **Done:** the sources are pinned and committed; the brief, the fetch script, the numbering script
  and the citation checker are in place.
- **Running:** four `paper-analyst` agents writing `docs/paper/analysis.md`, `claims.md`,
  `note-check.md` and `artifacts.md`.
- **Next steps:**
  1. consolidate `unspecified.md` and `traceability.md`;
  2. the four-persona review, saved verbatim to `docs/reviews/paper-analysis-2026-09-27/`;
  3. fixes, the blind-reader test, then TODO and this file updated.
- **If this session is lost:** run `bash playground/paper/fetch_sources.sh`, read
  `docs/paper/README.md`, and check which deliverables exist in `docs/paper/`.
